# Random-Link-JS

Random link on click from an array written on JS

Useful for having a fun click on your site to randomize what your visitor sees, for example, a link that takes you to different items on your portfolio everytime you click it. Adds some spice instead of using just a boring list to show your stuff, although the boring list always has to be there for the less gambling inclined people... (feeling lucky punk?)
